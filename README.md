# Chaos-in-non-linear-systems
The subject of chaos theory is unpredictability in the path of events. Chaos is the name given to  the irregular and unexpected time evolution of many nonlinear and complicated linear systems. 

This project was done to understand, code and build various chaotic dynamical systems.
